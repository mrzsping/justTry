// require is one od the few syncgronous I/O operations avaiable in Node.Because modules are used often and are typically included at the top of file, having require be synchronous helps keep code clean,ordered,and readable.

//if you create a module that populates both exports and module.exports, module.exports will be returned and exports will be ignored.

//exports is sdet up simply as a global reference to module.exports, which is defined as an empty object that you can add properties to.

//node includes a unique mechanism for code reuse that allows modules to be required without knowing their location in the filesysteam.
// core module -> node_modules ->parent directory -> MODE_MODULES environment variable

//the package.json file, when placed in a module directory, allows you to define yous module using a file other than index.js
//To specify an alternative to index.js, the package.json file must contain Javascript Object Notation data defining an object with a key named main that specifies the path, within the module directory, to the main file.
