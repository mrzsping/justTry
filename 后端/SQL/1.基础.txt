1. 获取所有: SELECT * FROM table_name;

2. 条件获取: SELECT column_name, column_name FROM table_name;

3. 返回唯一: SELECT DISTINCT: SELECT DISTINCT  column_name, column_name FROM table_name;

4. 使用比较符获取: SELECT column_name, column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value;(operator: = > < <> >= <= IN BETWEEN LIKE)

5. 逻辑'与'获取: SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value AND column_name operator value;

6. 逻辑'或'获取: SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value OR column_name operator value;

7. '与'结合'或': SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value AND (column_name operator value OR column_name operator value);

8. 排序: SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value ORDER BY column_name, column_name ASC;

9. 插入新纪录: INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2);

10. 限定列插入新纪录: INSERT INTO table_name (column_name, column_name) table_name VALUES (value1, value2);

11. 更新: UPDATE table_name SET column_name=value WHERE some_column = some_value;

12. 删除: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE some_column=some_value;
